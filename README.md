# Realign Cambs
## Site Introduction
Realign is a real business that specialises in deep tissue massage, sports massage, injury recovery and one on one coaching. The website had been made to showcase information about treatments that are offered and the positive impact they will have on your life. The users of the website will be able to find information about the company and the man behind the business, postitive benefits of having treatment, all of the treatments that are offered, where to find the company on social media and contact information with a booking page where there is an easy to navigate form to get booked in for the correct treatment.

## Ongoing Project
I would like to mention that I am challenging myself to keep this as an on-going project that will eventually be used as the official website for 'Realign' where clients can book appointments, get information on treatments and eventually have their own accounts with access granted to more indepth content and features.
