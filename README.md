# Realign Cambs
## Site Introduction
Realign is a real business that specialises in deep tissue massage, sports massage, injury recovery and one on one coaching. The website had been made to showcase information about treatments that are offered and the positive impact they will have on your life. The users of the website will be able to find information about the company and the man behind the business, postitive benefits of having treatment, all of the treatments that are offered, where to find the company on social media and contact information with a booking page where there is an easy to navigate form to get booked in for the correct treatment.

## Ongoing Project
I would like to mention that I am challenging myself to keep this as an on-going project that will eventually be used as the official website for 'Realign' where clients can book appointments, get information on treatments and eventually have their own accounts with access granted to more indepth content and features.

## Planning the website
### Site Purpose
 - To have clients understand the importance and benefits to getting treatment whilst trying not to overload them with information.
 - Allow users to enquire to book an appointment using the booking page and selecting the treatment they need.
 - Give a list of treatments available, with price and an explanation of whats inlcuded in the price.
 - Show images containing Gav, the man behind realign, to create a familiar face for new clients as they will have already seen him prior to their appointment.
### Easy to Navigate
 - I wanted to make my site easy to navigate to ensure that when people land on the site they are able to quickly see key information that naturaly leads you to booking an appointment.
 - Part of making the site easy to navigate came with the colour scheme I used, I opted for the colours that are very heavily used on the realign instagram and facebook pages, these colours when checked using a colour wheel/palette are a good match. This makes any navigation links easy to read and find your way around the page
### Target Audience
- The target audience for this website will be for people who; go to the gym, play sports, have an injury they need help with, have mobility problems, any general pain or muscle soreness and people who may want to get into better shape and maintain their body in general.
- People who go to the gym.
- People who play sports.
- People who have an injury they need help with recovery for.
- People who have problems with mobility or posture and want to correct this.
- People who have any general problem areas with pain or muscle soreness.
- People who want to get generally more active, in better shape and maintain their body to a higher standard via the one-to-one coaching service.
### How will I achieve all of this?
- Firstly the landing page has to be something that allows the user to instantly know where they are and what may be offered on this site. The home page for all screen sizes the site displays on will have a header with the logo 'Realign Cambs' with a welcome message below at the top of the main element with a short description of what realign specialises in and a little bit about the business.
- After landing on the Welcome message of the page learning the basic information of the service that may be offered I want to add a list of benefits to having treatment with realign, this will include things like general health benefits in day to day life aswell as benefits to those who like to push their bodies in the gym to cover all areas.
- By choosing the correct colours for the background and text I can achieve a sleek, easy to ready and navigate site. The darker blue background with the golden yellow text really pops and catches your eye onto key information.
- I want to add a fixed footer to the bottom of the screen housing the social media icons with href links to the respective pages, alongside the whatsapp link to open a chat to contact directly if you do not have either of the social medias.
#### Tools and Input from others
- Prior to deciding to undertake this project my mentor Alan suggested to included a parallax scroll effect using an image background. I really wanted to encorperate this into my page as it really allows the user to see what treatment may look like in the background whilst learning about the benefits of treatment and coming to realign for it.
- I got in touch with Gav, the owner of realign, prior to starting my project to see if it was an area he wanted to fill as he does not yet have a website. This is where not only my ideas came into the planning but Gavs did too, he wanted to have a simple and easy to use site so that existing clients or even potential new clients could select a treatment they wanted fill out the form with name, contact details and reason for booking then send the enquiry for him to then offer an appointment slot.
   - The reason he wanted the booking to be done this way is because he prides himself on making his treatments bespoke to every client, ie he does not want to accept a shorter appointment for a new client with no prior knowledge, by filling out the booking form this gives new clients a chance to give some information about their reason for booking and Gav can then contact and advise which treatment will be best suited.
   - I planned to consult Gav whilst making the website to ensure that things were looking and including the correct information as he imagined. This way the website will convey the image that he wants to bring across to any returning customer and potential new customers.
   - I wanted to write code for different ways parts of the page can be displayed and send screenshots to him so that he can decide which one best displays his image. Below will be an example of one of the many options he had to chose from, the choice he made is now the final look:
     ** Leave space for screenshots of header options

- Tools and extensions I plan to use to achieve my goal:
  - HTML and CSS validators, although being taught to use this at the end of the process I wanted to use this tool often throughout the process to check my code and make sure that there was not any invalid code that is inevitably redundent, this will also check for spelling errors in CSS.
